# Power-Bi

## What's Power BI?
Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft that enables users to visualize and analyze data with greater speed, efficiency, and understanding. It connects users to a wide range of data through easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports, and compelling visualizations that bring data to life.

| Microsoft        | Very detailed for a beginner but in the same time I felt like it teach a lot of unnecessary details. Definitely a good start for a beginner who knows nothing about Power Bi but honestly I believe there are better option out there.            | Beginner     | [Course Link]([https://example.com/john-doe-power-bi](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/microsoft-power-bi-data-analyst))   |
| Pragmatic Works       | Crash Course for a lot of features in Power Bi but it were so good. I definitely recommend for those who want to start learning about Power Bi and know some stuff about it especially the data modelling and DAX that they used in the short time. The projects also actually very good and not just for practice purpose.     | Beginner-Intermediate    | [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/@PragmaticWorks) |
| Maven Analytics | If for beginner who knows nothing about Power Bi, I would always recommend Maven. Extremely good extremely well through and the projects are well made. It has paywall tho but you can still find it in Udemy.     | Beginner-Advanced     | [Course Link](https://mavenanalytics.io/path/power-bi-specialist)    |
| Guy In The Cube | If you think you expert enough in Power Bi, watching this channel and you suddenly realized that you know nothing of it. It was so good and they teach you very well  | Beginner-Advanced     | [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/@GuyInACube)    |
| How To Power Bi | If anything, this guy teach you how to design your Power Bi well. The UI/UX, some unpredictable features. Remember, good design is also what makes a good dashboard.  | Advanced     | [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/@HowtoPowerBI)    |
| SQLBI | This is the one I recommend the most when you want to be an expert in Power Bi. Its Data Modelling, Advanced DAX will teach you better than any places but well its under paywall so good luck.  | Advanced     | [Course Link](https://www.sqlbi.com/training/)   |
